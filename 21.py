```python
# Define a tuple
number_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Print the tuple
print(number_tuple)

# Print the element at index 1
print(number_tuple[1])

# Attempt to insert an element at index 1 (this will raise a TypeError)
# number_tuple[1] = 10  # Uncommenting this line will cause an error

# Count occurrences of an item in the tuple
print(number_tuple.count(2))

# Find the index of the first occurrence of an item
print(number_tuple.index(2))
```
